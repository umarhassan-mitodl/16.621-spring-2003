Because the faculty recognize that high quality communication is essential in engineering practice, the 16.621 course is designated as communication-intensive. This means that communication instruction and practice is thoroughly integrated into the engineering instruction. Communication is evaluated and forms part of the student's grade. Part of this section includes some of the resources that supplement the technical communication lecture notes. This section also includes Technical Resources.
