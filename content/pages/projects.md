This section provides samples of student work from past semesters of 16.621. Each of these models meets the standards of the course although they may differ slightly from each other. The Statements of Project documents were due in week 7 of the semester. These documents described the background and significance of the project, proposed an hypothesis, objective, and success criteria, and gave a brief overview of the experiment.
